        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most intriguing targets in the main asteroid belt, Psyche is a giant metal-rich asteroid, about three times farther away from the Sun than is Earth. Its average diameter is about 140 miles (226 kilometers) - about one-sixteenth the diameter of Earth's Moon or about the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego.
        </p>

        <p>
          Psyche might be the partial core of a shattered planetesimal - a small world the size of a city or small country that is the first building block of a planet. If it is, asteroid Psyche can offer a close look at the interior of terrestrial planets like Earth which is normally hidden beneath layers of mantle and crust.

            NASA's Eyes program provides a series of web apps that allow the public to see the solar system and the objects in it in real-time 3D.

        <h3>Psyche Mission</h3>
        <p>
          This intriguing asteroid is now the primary target of NASA's planned Psyche mission. The Psyche spacecraft is targeted to travel to the asteroid using solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion, following a Mars flyby and a gravity assist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once in orbit, the spacecraft will map and study Psyche using a multispectral imager, a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a radio instrument (for gravity measurement). The mission's goal is, among other things, to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planetesimal.
        </p>
        <h3>How Psyche Asteroid Got Its Name</h3>
        <p>
          Psyche was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on March 17, 1852. He named the asteroid for Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul who was born mortal and married Eros (Roman Cupid), the god of Love.
